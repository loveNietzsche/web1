<h2>Marx</h2>
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx" target="_blank">Marx</a>  was a German<strong> philosopher, economist, historian, sociologist, political theorist, journalist and socialist revolutionary.</strong>
Born in Trier, Germany, Marx studied law and philosophy at university.
<p>
Marx's theories about society, economics and politics – collectively understood as Marxism – hold that human societies develop through class struggle. </p>
<p>
  In capitalism, this manifests itself in the conflict between the ruling classes (known as the bourgeoisie) that control the means of production and the working classes
</p>
<p>
  (known as the proletariat) that enable these means by selling their labour power in return for wages.
