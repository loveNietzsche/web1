<h2>Nietzsche</h2>
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche" target="_blank">Nietzsche</a> was a German philosopher, cultural critic, composer, poet,
philologist, and Latin and Greek scholar whose work has exerted a profound
<strong>influence on Western philosophy</<strong></strong> and modern <strong>intellectual <u>history</u>.</strong>
<p>
He began his career as a classical philologist before turning to philosophy. He became the youngest ever to hold the Chair of Classical Philology at the University of Basel in 1869 at the age of 24.

<p>
Nietzsche resigned in 1879 due to health problems that plagued him most of his life; he completed much of his core writing in the following decade. In 1889 at age 44, he suffered a collapse and afterward, a complete loss of his mental faculties.
