<h2>Kant</h2>
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant" target="_blank">Kant</a> Immanuel Kant was an influential German philosopher. In his doctrine of transcendental idealism, he argued that space, time and causation are mere sensibilities; "things-in-themselves" exist, but their nature is unknowable.
<strong>In his view, the mind shapes and structures experience, with all human experience sharing certain structural features.</strong>

In one of Kant's major works, the Critique of Pure Reason</p>

he attempted to explain the relationship between reason and human experience and to move beyond the failures of traditional philosophy and metaphysics.</p>
